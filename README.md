#### Unit 01: Some Mathematics Relevant to Regression

In this unit we will explore common formulas and rules that will be used to prove and mathematiclly illustrate ideas in regression. In addition to the materials in the `notes` folder and what we cover in class, there many resources online. Google search terms include:

- "Summation rules"
- "Expectation rules"
- "Covariance rules"
- "Variance rules"
